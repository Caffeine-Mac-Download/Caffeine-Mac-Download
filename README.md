📌 About Caffeine for macOS
Caffeine for Mac is a lightweight utility designed to keep your Mac awake and prevent it from going into sleep mode, dimming the screen, or activating the screensaver. Sitting quietly in your menu bar, Caffeine provides a simple toggle that ensures your display stays on when needed — whether you're watching a video, giving a presentation, running long processes, or reading something important without touching your keyboard or mouse.

With no clutter or complex settings, Caffeine is the go-to tool for professionals, developers, students, and power users who need full control over their Mac’s power behavior. It’s minimal, intuitive, and extremely effective at one job — keeping your Mac alert on your terms.

Caffeine is compatible with both Intel and Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3) Macs and works seamlessly across macOS versions. Whether you're using a MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac, or Mac mini, Caffeine keeps you in charge of your screen activity with a single click.
